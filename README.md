How to add spoiler tag on discord

Discord is a new community website where you can connect with your gaming friends and create a private chat lobby or chat group to have conversation over VoIP. Discord is free and easy to use and offers a lot of features.

sometimes it may create a problem to share some secret in your group chat and showing it to people who rather choose not seeing it because of some reasons. 

to address this problem discord has introducted a Discord Spoiler tag which hides the text and can only be visible for people who click on "Reveal Text" button.
